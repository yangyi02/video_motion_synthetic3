## Same Model as Exp002 But Loss Consider New Appear Pixels

- Baseline: Exp002
- Occlusion modeling, moving pixels will occlude static pixels
- Predict motion for every pixel
- Photometric loss for pixels that are not occluded

### Results

- Column 2 and 3: Improve reconstruction loss over baseline (%)

### Take Home Message

- Although this significantly improves test loss, the optical flow estimation actually becomes much worse when motion range is larger than 1.
- It is interesting to see when motion range is limited to 1, this helps on motion prediction.
- However, once motion range is increased to 2, the model significantly degenerate to a very bad local optimal.
